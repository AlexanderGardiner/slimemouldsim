# slimemouldsim README

## Overview

This project is a simplified simulation of slime mold behavior, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary challenge in developing this simulation was optimizing it to efficiently run in the browser, especially when handling a large number of agents.

## Features

- **Slime Mold Behavior**: The simulation models the behavior of slime moulds as they try to aim towards other moulds near them, therefore creating their unique structure
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Utilizes efficient algorithms for agent movement and interaction to minimize computational overhead.

- **Canvas Rendering**: Leverages HTML5 Canvas for rendering graphics, which provides better performance compared to traditional DOM manipulation.
